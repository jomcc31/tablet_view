            <p>A fluffy black, white, and tan Shiba Inu with pointed ears named Bear.
            Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.</p>
            <p>Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn't like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he's sometimes even so lazy that he'll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home.</p>

            <p>Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He's pretty friendly, but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.</p>
           
            <p>Whenever it's movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.</p>

            <p>Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He's a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.</p>
           
            <p>Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.</p>

            <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>
           
            <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human food such as lettuce.</p>

            <p>Honey's favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we come up for air. 
            </p>
           
            <p>While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub.</p>

            <p>Molly's favorite habit is to brush against people's legs, especially during dinner when everyone is seated around a table. She's an attention seeker, always meowing to get as many pets and head rubs as she possibly can.</p>
